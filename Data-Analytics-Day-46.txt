 Topics & Explanations

1. Introduction to Machine Learning in Analytics
==============================================
Machine Learning (ML) is the next step after traditional analytics.
Instead of only describing data, ML predicts future outcomes or classifies data automatically.

Two major types for analysts:
----------------------------
Regression → Predicting continuous values (e.g., sales, revenue).
Classification → Predicting categories (e.g., churn: yes/no).


2. Regression Basics (Predicting Numbers)
=======================================
Regression finds a relationship between input (X) and output (Y).

Example: Predicting house prices using size, location, and rooms.

Types:
------
Linear Regression → straight-line relationships.
Multiple Regression → uses multiple input factors.
Real-World Use: Forecasting monthly sales, predicting customer lifetime value.


3. Classification Basics (Predicting Categories)
==============================================
Classification predicts labels instead of numbers.

Example: Will a customer churn? ✅ Yes or ❌ No.

Common algorithms:
------------------
Logistic Regression (despite the name, it’s classification).
Decision Trees.
Random Forests.
Real-World Use: Fraud detection, loan approval, spam email detection.


4. Training & Testing Data
=========================
Data is split into training (to build model) and testing (to evaluate).
Helps avoid overfitting (when the model memorizes instead of learning patterns).
Analysts usually follow a 70-30 split or 80-20 split.


5. Evaluation Metrics
====================
For Regression: R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE).
For Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Choosing the right metric depends on the business goal.
